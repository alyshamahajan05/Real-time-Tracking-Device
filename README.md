# Real-time-Tracking-Device
The Real-Time Tracking Project built with Node.js and Socket.IO allows users to track the real-time location of assets, vehicles, or users through live updates. The system uses Socket.IO to establish a WebSocket connection between the client and the server, enabling instant communication and real-time data updates. Node.js serves as the backend to handle incoming location data and broadcast it to all connected clients, ensuring that updates are visible to users without delay. This project can be used for fleet management, delivery tracking, or any scenario requiring live location monitoring.
